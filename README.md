#Exif plugin for WordPress#

This is a plugin that parses out the exif data from an uploaded image and adds the data to attachment fields for easy outputting. It also generates a description based on the Exif data.

The plugin is pretty useless because wordpress already saves this data on image upload, something I noticed after the fact. But anyway, here it is.

[I've written a blog post describing this plugin, and what it does and how it does it.][1]
